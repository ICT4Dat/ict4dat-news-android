We developed this application for the ICT4D and Digital Development Community.

We believe in diversity and the benefits coming with it. We are proud of being an international team of students from 3 different continents (Africa, Asia and Europe) and 5 different countries. The core team consists of three members: Noah Alorwu, who is active in Ghana, Raja Saboor Ali is strongly committed in Pakistan and Paul Spiesberger is involved from Austria. We also have support from Job Guitiche, who contributes from Mozambique and Chlo√© Zimmermann, a designer from France.

This application was developed by ICT4D.at as an Open Source Software. You can contribute and/or file bugs at GitHub: https://github.com/ICT4Dat/ict4dat-news-android/
